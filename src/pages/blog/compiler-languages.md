    If you are a programmer, you should be familiar with the concepts of "interpreted languages" and "compiler languages". A proper understanding of interpreted languages ​​and compilers are both the most important tools useful for software development.
    In this article, we review and introduce compiler languages ​​and explain their advantages, disadvantages and meaning.
    Stay with us to review and introduce compiler languages ​​in this article.

## What is a compiler language?
As you know, the computer does not understand high-level programming languages; Therefore, we need an intermediary that converts the program into machine code.
A compiled language is a language whose source code is translated into executable code by a compiler. In the compiler language, the compiler converts the source code completely into executable code using its own algorithms. In the following, this executable code can be entered and executed in the operating system. In a compiled language, before executing the program, the compiler will translate the source code into machine code. Machine code is understandable for processors and can be directly executed. This executable code does not need to install runtime and has more optimal performance than interpreted languages. However, changes to the source code require recompilation and re-generation of the executable code.

## Advantages and disadvantages of compiler languages
Compiler languages, in addition to having advantages such as high speed and code optimization, have some disadvantages that should be considered. In this section, the advantages and disadvantages of compiler languages ​​will be discussed:

### Advantages of compiler languages
Program execution speed: Compiler languages ​​have a much higher program execution speed than interpreted languages ​​due to the conversion of the entire program into machine code in the compilation process.
Program optimization: In compiler languages, the compiler has the ability to automatically optimize the code, so the code produced by the compiler is more optimized and increases the speed of program execution.
Detect compile time errors: In compiled languages, program errors are detected in the compilation process and announced to the user. In other words, by using the compiler language, program errors can be identified in the development stage and fixed.
High stability: Because the compiled code is saved as an executable file, programs run with higher stability. This means that changes in the software will not cause more errors.

### Disadvantages of compiler languages
Difficulty in running the program on different platforms: To run compiled programs on different systems, the program must be compiled separately for each system. This makes it difficult to run the program on different platforms.
More compile time: Compiled languages, unlike interpreted languages, need more time to compile programs. This may cause delays in the implementation of large and complex programs.
Inability to run the program during compilation: In compiled languages, the program must first be compiled and then run. This makes it impossible to run the program during compilation, which sometimes causes problems.
Coding for programmers: Coding can be more difficult and complicated for programmers of compiled programs. Also, this issue will increase the costs and time of program development.
Some security issues: Because compiled programs are available as binary and executable code, there may be some security issues that can be easily solved in interpreted programs.

## Examples of compiler languages
Below are some of the most popular and widely used compiler languages:
* C
* Java
* C++
* Python: Actually, Python is an interpreted programming language, but some implementations can use a combination of interpreter and compiler.
