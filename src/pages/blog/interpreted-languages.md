  If you are a programmer, you should be familiar with the concepts of "interpreted languages" and "compiler languages". Proper understanding of interpreter and compiler languages ​​are both the most important tools that are useful for software development.
  In this article, we will review and introduce interpreted languages ​​and explain its advantages, disadvantages and meaning.
  Stay with us to review and introduce interpretive languages ​​in this article.

## What is an interpretive language?
As you know, the computer does not understand high-level programming languages; Therefore, we need an intermediary that converts the program into machine code.
Interpreted languages ​​are languages ​​whose programming codes are executed line by line by an interpreter. In this way, the interpreter receives the programming code and interprets its lines in order to convert it into understandable language for the computer. For this reason, interpreted languages ​​do not need to compile the programming code and instead, the code is executed as it is stored in their text file.



## Advantages and disadvantages of interpreted languages
As mentioned earlier, interpreted languages ​​use an interpreter to run their code. To detect errors in the code, the interpreter first performs the necessary checks and then executes the code. In the following, the advantages and disadvantages of using interpretive languages ​​are discussed:

### Advantages of interpreted languages
Ease of writing code: you don't need deep computer knowledge to write code in interpreted languages; To run the code, it is enough to have an appropriate interpreter installed for that language.
Fast code execution: In interpreted languages, the code will be executed immediately after typing. For this reason, code execution time in interpreted languages ​​is less than compiled languages.
Good debugging facilities: in interpreted languages, due to the execution of commands in real-time, debugging facilities can be used more efficiently.

### Disadvantages of interpreted languages
Slowness in code execution: Interpreted languages ​​face slowness at runtime due to line-by-line translation and code execution for each line. This problem is especially prominent in programs with high volumes and complex commands, whose execution slows down performance.
Visible source code: In interpreted languages, the source code is visible at runtime and can be easily attacked.
Need to install an interpreter: To run programs written with interpreted languages, the interpreter of that language needs to be installed on the user's system. This issue is considered as a weakness in using interpreted languages.
The possibility of creating errors: due to the execution of the code in real time and because the codes written with interpreted languages ​​are translated and executed line by line, if the written code does not work correctly, the possibility of creating errors increases.

## Examples of interpreted languages
Below are some of the popular and widely used interpretation languages:
* Python
* Java Script
* ruby
* Perl
* PHP
