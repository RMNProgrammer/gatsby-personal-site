    Programming languages ​​have a high variety and each has its own uses, advantages and disadvantages.
    One of the object-oriented and high-level programming languages ​​that has many applications is Python.
    Python is one of the languages ​​that are very easy to learn and people who just want to enter the world of programming can choose this language.
    In the following, we will introduce the Python programming language and explain the uses and advantages of this language.

## What is the Python programming language?
Python is one of the object-oriented multipurpose languages ​​that was designed and published for the first time in 1991.
One of the most important reasons for creating the Python programming language is the high readability of the codes.
Python is designed in such a way that the programmer can clearly and unambiguously create large and small programming projects.
The Python programming language is quite versatile and can be used almost anywhere where data, mathematical calculations or lines of code are used.
For example, unlike Java, Python is not limited to use for web development.
The high level of Python programming language means that the written codes are closer to human language and English language than machine language.
Python code is written in less time than other languages ​​such as Java.
Python programming is one of the easiest programming languages ​​to read and learn.
In this language, code blocks are not written in braces, and instead, spaces are used to write codes. 

## The purpose of creating the Python programming language
The designer of Python programming has stated his goal of creating the following reasons:
* A very simple and understandable language that has high power and has the ability to compete with other programming languages.
* It is completely open source so that all people and programmers can participate in its development.
* Its simplicity is enough to have high readability similar to an English text.
* It is possible to develop the program with the help of Python in the shortest possible time.

## Python programming language features
* High readability
* Easy to run
* Expandable
* Open text

## The most important applications of Python programming language
* Web design
* Machine learning
* Data analysis
* Making mobile applications
* Making computer games

## The most important advantages of the Python programming language
Below are some of the most important advantages of Python:
* Popularity and accessibility: Python has a large community to support it.
  This feature makes it easy to solve the problems encountered during the learning process. Also, this software is free and open source.
* Easy to learn: Python programming has an easy to learn syntax and uses English words.
* Readability: Lines of code written in Python are also easy to read. For example, Python uses a nice clean break in the form of a new line of code instead of a semicolon or comma to complete a command.
* Scalability: You can start writing programs in Python without having to worry about the hard work of rewriting or adapting code for other platforms as you scale.

## Disadvantages of Python programming language
Despite the advantages that Python has for solving some problems, it also has disadvantages, which we will introduce below:
* Weak in mobile processing: It is true that Python is fast in desktop and server   processing, but it is weak in mobile processing, and that is why there are not many mobile applications written in this language.
* Slowdown: Since Python uses an interpreter instead of a compiler, it has some impact on its speed.
* Difficulty in using other languages: due to the fact that the programming commands in Python are very simple and there is no need to use commas, periods, etc., it is possible that programmers proficient in Python will have problems when dealing with other programming languages. See other languages ​​as complex.
* Runtime Errors: It can be said that the codes written in Python need more testing time and it is possible that the programs will encounter errors at the end when they are executed.
