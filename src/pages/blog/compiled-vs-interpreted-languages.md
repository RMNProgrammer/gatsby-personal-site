    If you are a programmer, you must be familiar with concepts such as "interpreted languages" and "compiler languages".
    A proper understanding of interpreted languages ​​and compilers are both of the most important tools that will come in handy for software development.
    In this article, after explaining the concepts, advantages and disadvantages of compiler and interpreter languages, we compare the two.

## Comparison of interpreted and compiled languages
The similarities and differences between interpreted and compiled languages ​​are very important and significant.
These two groups of languages ​​have some similar features, but at the same time they differ from each other in many features.
In this post, we will compare and explain the similarities and differences between interpreted languages ​​and compiler languages:

## similarities
1. Both types of languages ​​allow the user to write their program in a specific language and translate it into a language that the computer can understand.
2. Both types of languages ​​have similar control structures that include loops, conditionals, and functions.
3. In both types of languages, programs written can run on different operating systems.
4. Both types of languages ​​are designed to produce programs with high performance and high execution speed.
5. Both types of languages ​​can be used to create large and complex programs.
6. Both types of languages ​​can achieve similar results in the execution of programs if the correct and optimal code is written.

## The differences
* Execution method: Interpreted languages ​​interpret the code at the time of execution and execute it line by line. While compiled languages ​​translate the code at compile time and execute the compiled output.
* Execution speed: Undoubtedly, compiled languages ​​are better in the execution speed of programs. Because the compiler fully translates the code into machine language and its output is optimal and fast. On the other hand, interpreted languages ​​have to interpret and then execute the code for each command that needs to be executed, which slows down the execution of the program.
* Debugging: Debugging for compiled languages ​​can be a little difficult because errors that occur at compile time must be handled by the coder. In contrast, interpreted languages ​​can facilitate debugging due to the interpretation of commands.
* Exception Throwers: Unlike compiled languages, interpreted languages ​​throw exceptions by default. This means that if an error occurs during the execution of the program, the program will stop and an error will be displayed to the user.
